# Temporary Hyprland Window Rules for Bar
# Add these to your ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf

# Make the Bar window behave like a bar (completely immovable and protected)
windowrulev2 = float, title:(SableUI)
windowrulev2 = pin, title:(SableUI)              # Pin to all workspaces
windowrulev2 = stayfocused, title:(SableUI)      # Don't lose focus
windowrulev2 = noborder, title:(SableUI)         # No border
windowrulev2 = noblur, title:(SableUI)           # No blur effects
windowrulev2 = noshadow, title:(SableUI)         # No shadow
windowrulev2 = noanim, title:(SableUI)           # No animations
windowrulev2 = nofocus, title:(SableUI)          # Don't steal focus from other windows
windowrulev2 = noinitialfocus, title:(SableUI)   # Don't focus on spawn

# Position at top of screen with 40px height and full width
windowrulev2 = move 0 0, title:(SableUI)
windowrulev2 = size 100% 40, title:(SableUI)

# Keep it above other windows but below notifications
# Layer options: bottom, top (default for floating), overlay
# windowrulev2 = layer top, title:(SableUI)  # Uncomment if windows cover it

# Alternative: If you want it on the side (vertical bar)
# windowrulev2 = move 0 0, title:(SableUI)
# windowrulev2 = size 40 100%, title:(SableUI)

# Note: You may need to change "title:(SableUI)" to match your window
# To find the exact window identifier, run:
#   hyprctl clients | grep -A 10 "Bar"
# You might need to use class:(Bar) instead of title:(SableUI)

# After adding these rules, reload with: hyprctl reload
